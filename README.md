export shareIO_MAX_FILE_SIZE=200

./shareIO
```

## Configuration Examples

### Home Network File Sharing
```bash
# Default settings - accessible to all network devices
./shareIO
```

### Secure Local Development
```bash
# Localhost only access
./shareIO --bind 127.0.0.1 --port 3000

```bash
# Use specific directory for uploads
./shareIO --upload-dir ./shared_files --delete-after 30m
```

## Network Access

When shareIO starts, it displays:
```
shareIO v1.0.0 starting...
Upload directory: C:\Users\...\Temp\shareIO_uploads
Files auto-delete after: 5m0s
Maximum file size: 100 MB
Server bind address: 0.0.0.0
Server port: 8000

Access URLs:
  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:8000
  Network: http://192.168.1.100:8000

Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```

Share the **Network URL** with other devices to allow file sharing access.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Port already in use" error**
```bash
./shareIO --port 8001
```

**Can't access from other devices**
- Ensure devices are on the same network
- Check firewall settings on the host machine
- Verify the server is bound to `0.0.0.0` (default)
- Try accessing via the displayed Network URL

**File upload fails**
- Check available disk space in upload directory
- Verify file doesn't exceed size limit (default: 100MB)
- Ensure upload directory has write permissions

**"File too large" error**
```bash
./shareIO --max-file-size 500  # Increase to 500MB
```

**Server fails to start**
- Check if the port is available
- Verify directory permissions for upload path
- Run `./shareIO --help` to verify command syntax

### Debug Information

The application provides helpful startup information:
- Upload directory location
- Current configuration settings
- Access URLs for local and network connections
- File auto-delete timing

### Network Connectivity

To verify network access:
1. Note the "Network" URL displayed at startup
2. Try accessing from another device's browser
3. Check that devices are on the same network subnet
4. Temporarily disable firewalls for testing

## Use Cases

- **Development Teams**: Quick file sharing during meetings
- **Presentations**: Share slides and documents in conference rooms
- **Home Networks**: Transfer files between family devices
- **Offline Environments**: File sharing without internet access
